A ROS Noetic package that integrates ORB-SLAM3 with Intel RealSense D455 cameras for real-time visual SLAM and 3D reconstruction. This wrapper processes RGB-D data from the RealSense camera to generate accurate camera trajectories and point cloud maps of the environment. The implementation includes custom launch files, camera configurations, and modified ORB-SLAM3 interfaces optimized for RealSense's depth sensing capabilities.
